# Devrob-Assessment
The piper robotic arm was used for this simulation. Custom launch files were created named as custom_gazebo.launch.py and custom_rviz.launch.py. The C++ API of Moveit 2 was used for creating the node that gave the waypoints for the robot end effector to move through and the file is named devrob_move_program.cpp . The working method is to give waypoint poses to the robot end effector(in this case link 6) using the C++ API of Moveit 2 that uses computeCartesianPath to execute those waypoints. Due to an issue related to time stamp the joint states where not received which led abandonment of the planning but it generated few waypoints with samll % completed of the planning. But when the Goal Pose method was used where you give x,y,z coordinates and x,y,z,w orientation for the end effector, reachable goals where achieved and when "Use Cartesian Path" feature of Motion Planning was used waypoints were successfully generated and some poses had 100% trajectory execution. Even though the /clock topic was echoed to know if an issue related to time stamp was there, but it was correctly getting updated. Even though use_sim_time was set to true in all the nodes, the issue still persisted. Even when the devrob_move_program node was added to the cusom_rviz.launch.py file the issue still persisted. The issue does not seem to be from that but it prevents the generation of waypoints and the cartesian path could only be partially planned.
